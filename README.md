# Test A Perceptual Phenomenon (Stroop Effect)

**Summary**

In this project, a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop effect is investigated. I learnt a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task. I looked at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted the results in terms of the hypotheses.

**project flow:**

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant&#39;s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed (RED, BLUE). In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed (PURPLE, ORANGE). In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

the project steps to analyse and  visualise to get conclusions are the answers of next questions:

1. What are the independent and the dependent variables?
2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? Specify  null and alternative hypotheses, and clearly define any notation used. Justify choices.
3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.
4. Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots?
5. Perform the statistical test and report your results. What is your confidence level or Type I error associated with your test? What is your conclusion regarding the hypotheses you set up? Did the results match up with your expectations? Hint: Think about what is being measured on each individual, and what statistic best captures how an individual reacts in each environment?

**The Conclusion**

The t-statistic (calculated T value) of degrees of freedom (23) is 8.021 which greater than the t-critical value (2.500)( in T table), hence it falls under the critical region (rejection) so that the null hypothesis is rejected because the results, that I received, are statistically significant at p \&lt; 0.01 level and accepted the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is a difference between the time taken to read Incongruent word for the time taken to read congruent word and the largest difference is 21.92 seconds.
